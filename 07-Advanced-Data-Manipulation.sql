/* Goal: Work with multiple tables and complex data manipulations.
        Example: Write a procedure that aggregates data from several related tables (e.g., total sales by customer over a date range).
        Practice:
            Joins (INNER, OUTER).
            Subqueries.
            Aggregations (SUM, COUNT, GROUP BY).
