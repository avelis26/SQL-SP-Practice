Goal: Execute SQL statements built dynamically at runtime.
        Example: Write a procedure that constructs a SELECT query based on input parameters (table name, column names).
        Practice:
            Use PREPARE, EXECUTE, and DEALLOCATE to handle dynamic queries.
            Handling SQL injection risks.
