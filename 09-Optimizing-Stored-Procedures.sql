/* Goal: Optimize the performance of procedures.
        Example: Tune a procedure that processes large datasets to minimize execution time.
        Practice:
            Using indexes effectively.
            Analyzing queries with EXPLAIN.
            Minimizing loops and using set-based operations instead.
