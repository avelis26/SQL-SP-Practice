/* Goal: Test and debug stored procedures using logging and error trapping.
        Example: Write a procedure that logs execution details (start time, end time, row count) to a log table.
        Practice:
            Adding logging functionality.
            Using error handlers to debug failures.
            Writing test cases for each procedure.
