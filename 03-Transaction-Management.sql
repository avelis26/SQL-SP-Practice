/* Goal: Implement transactions to ensure data integrity.
        Example: Write a procedure that transfers money between accounts, using transactions to commit/rollback changes.
        Practice:
            START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, ROLLBACK.
            Handling concurrent operations with locks or isolation levels.
            Error recovery using transactions.
