Goal: Manage errors gracefully using error handlers.
        Example: Write a procedure that performs INSERT operations, but rolls back the transaction if an error occurs.
        Practice:
            Use of DECLARE handlers for specific errors (CONTINUE, EXIT).
            Logging errors or rethrowing them to the caller.
